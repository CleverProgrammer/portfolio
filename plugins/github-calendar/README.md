## :memo: Documentation


### `GitHubCalendar(container, username, options)`
Brings the contributions calendar from GitHub (provided username) into your page.

#### Params

- **String|HTMLElement** `container`: The calendar container (query selector or the element itself).
- **String** `username`: The GitHub username.
- **Object** `options`: An object containing the following fields:
 - `summary_text` (String): The text that appears under the calendar (defaults to: `"Summary of
   pull requests, issues opened, and commits made by <username>"`).
 - `proxy` (Function): A function that receives as argument an url (string) and should return the proxied url.
   The default is using [@izuzak](https://github.com/izuzak)'s [`urlreq`](https://github.com/izuzak/urlreq).
 - `global_stats` (Boolean): If `false`, the global stats (total, longest and current streaks) will not be calculated and displayed. By default this is enabled.
 - `responsive` (Boolean): If `true`, the graph is changed to scale with the container. Custom CSS should be applied to the element to scale it appropriately. By default this is disabled.

#### Return
- **Promise** A promise returned by the `fetch()` call.

## :sparkling_heart: Support my projects

I open-source almost everything I can, and I try to reply everyone needing help using these projects. Obviously,
this takes time. You can integrate and use these projects in your applications *for free*! You can even change the source code and redistribute (even resell it).

However, if you get some profit from this or just want to encourage me to continue creating stuff, there are few ways you can do it:

 - Starring and sharing the projects you like :rocket:
 - [![Buy me a book][badge_amazon]][amazon]—I love books! I will remember you after years if you buy me one. :grin: :book:
 - [![PayPal][badge_paypal]][paypal-donations]—You can make one-time donations via PayPal. I'll probably buy a ~~coffee~~ tea. :tea:
 - [![Support me on Patreon][badge_patreon]][patreon]—Set up a recurring monthly donation and you will get interesting news about what I'm doing (things that I don't share with everyone).
 - **Bitcoin**—You can send me bitcoins at this address (or scanning the code below): `1P9BRsmazNQcuyTxEqveUsnf5CERdq35V6`

Thanks! :heart:


## :cake: Thanks

 - Big thanks to [**@izuzak**](https://github.com/izuzak) for creating the [urlreq](https://github.com/izuzak/urlreq) project–the default proxy used by this library. :cake:
 - Part of the CSS code was taken from the GitHub profile page to offer the same experience. :art:
